# ASEN_3200
Orbit Mechanics and Attitude Control
ASEN 3200 contained 6 labs, three in each topic of the course (three attitude control labs and three orbit mechanics labs). The first part of the course used a few methods for attitude control and the dynamics that result.  The second half of the course focused on using STK to reveal a couple modeling techniques for satellite missions.
